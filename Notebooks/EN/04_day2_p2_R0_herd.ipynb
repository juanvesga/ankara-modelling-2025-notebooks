    "We have built a SIR model, have explored how variation in main model parameters can affect the epidemic size and have assessed model outputs from a fully dynamic SIR model. In theory we have explored concepts of R0, Reff , herd immunity threshold and population renewal. In this practice we will build in our previous practice to explore these concepts further.   \n",

    "SARS-Cov2 actively transmitted form human to human in virtually every country of the world for the past 2 years. Since the end of 2019 we have accrued important insights into the core dynamics of the virus and have been able to quantify important parameters to describe its transmission. Here we will adapt our previous SIR model to reflect important characteristics of SARS-Cov2, and will rely on published literature to inform our model.    \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that SARS-Cov2 is transmitted human to human, we also know that transmission is followed by an incubation period which ends with most individuals developing a symptomatic form of the disease. Individuals are not infectious during the incubation period. Liu et al, 2020, in their systematic review have estimated an R0 value with median of 2.79 (ranging from 1.5 to 6.68)(1). Similarly, McAloon et al have reviewed the duration of the incubation period and found a mean value of 5.8 days (CI95% 5-6.7)(2). The infectious period is one of the most heterogeneous pieces of information given the wide variations in disease severity. However, for simplicity we can say that the average infectious period (from symptom onset to having a negative PCR) is ~ 13 days, as reported elsewhere (3). Finally, the case fatality rate for covid-19 is understood to follow important age patterns and also between country variations. However, for simplicity we will take an estimate of 4% (4).   \n",
