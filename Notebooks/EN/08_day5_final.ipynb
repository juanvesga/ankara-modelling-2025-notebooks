    "\n",
    "As a modeller you are asked to use the existing outbreak data to create and calibrate a model for NoV transmission in different age groups and use it to see if the outbreak can be reproduced by simulation. A systematic review of the existing knowledge on Norovirus has found the following main points: Human Norovirus causes outbreaks of gastroenteritis principally among young children and the elderly. A symptomatic case has a duration of 2 days in average, with an incubation period of no more than 1 day. After a symptomatic period individuals can shed virus in their stools for about 15 days, which makes them slightly infectious but drastically less than a fully symptomatic case.\n",

    "It is expected for the total size of the outbreak to be much larger, given that only a fraction of the cases of GE get reported or go to hospital. This is even more clear for the elderly who can rapidly deteriorate after contracting GE. For this reason you should correct your out put using previously estimated ratios of community cases per reported case (in the code below).\n",

See [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697). POLYMOD projects contact matrix for over 152 countries. We are using a matrix estimated for Turkiye.
