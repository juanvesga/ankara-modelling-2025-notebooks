The ongoing epidemiological investigation have identified the following facts that might guide you in your model development:\n",

    "1)  Why is the homogeneous assumption of risk of infection a simplification and what factors can affect this? What are potential sources of heterogeneity?\n",
    "\n",

    "2)  What factors might affect our assumption of a homogeneous p across the population?\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer: p is the probability of transmission per contact. This constant can widely vary given the type of contact, the intensity and duration of the contact and even the phase of disease of the infection donor in each contact. So it is a simplification, but it holds well for describing the population level behavior of the outbreak.**"
